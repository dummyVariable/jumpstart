# Lab 4: Add a navbar and link to pages Admin and Orders

This lab is to apply your knowledge of react router in a typical use case.

## Feature details

- Navigate to the food-app project directory on your computer
- checkout to the lab 4 branch

```
  git checkout lab4
  git branch
```

- You are required to install the react dependancy required for routing

```
  npm install react-router-dom
```

- In this lab you are required to create a NavBar linking to 3 pages:

  - Home page
    - http://localhost:3000/home
  - Admin
    - http://localhost:3000/admin
  - My Orders
    - http://localhost:3000/orders

- Create 2 react components

  - AdminPage
    - in src/components/AdminPage/AdminPage.jsx
    - Display a blank page with the words "Admin Page"
    - In a later lab you will build an admin console here, to view and manage the restaurant list
    -
  - Order Page
    - in src/components/OrderPage/OrderPage.jsx
    - Display a blank page with the words "OrderPage"

- When you click on the link in the NavBar the page navigates to the corresponding page

- When you click on the FoodApp brand icon, it also navigates to the HomePage

## Expected Output

These screenshots are a sample of the expected output

![Home Page](../../../.gitbook/assets/front-end-web-development/react/food-app-labs/lab4-output-1.png)

![Admin Page](../../../.gitbook/assets/front-end-web-development/react/food-app-labs/lab4-output-2.png)

![My Orders page](../../../.gitbook/assets/front-end-web-development/react/food-app-labs/lab4-output-3.png)

## Hints

- Use the [bootstrap navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/#nav) style
- To get the icon for the FoodApp brand, install fontawesome

```
  npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free"
```

## Solution

- After you have completed Lab 4, please commit all your work to the `lab4` branch

- You may optionally install the plugin **Git History Diff** for viewing the difference between git branches. This will allow you to easily compare your work with the sample solution

- [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huizhou.githd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huizhou.githd)

- Next checkout to the solution branch and we will now walk through the sample solution

```text
git checkout lab5
```

- To view the difference between your work and the sample solution go to the VS Code file explorer, right click your folder and select `GitHD: View Folder Diff` and select compare with `lab4` branch

- The diff sidebar will popup and you can click on the files to view the difference between your work and the sample solution.

- When viewing the diff you can temporarily toggle the sidebar with `cmd + B` to hide it.

## Testing

- Next we will discuss how to test the feature with react testing library
- To simulate browsing history in the test we will need to install another library

```
  npm install history --save-dev
```
