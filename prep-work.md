# Prep Work

Since your time during the course is precious, we won't spend a lot of time on the basics.

Learning checklist

* Get familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS
* Get familiar with the basics of JavaScript
* Improve your typing speed

As you can imagine, we all have different approaches to learning. Some of us prefer watching videos while others prefer reading books.

If you feel the recommended learning resources are not helping you, then visit our [resources](resources.md) page for other suggestions.

## HTML/CSS

If you're completely new to HTML and CSS, we recommend you watch these two videos:

* [HTML Crash Course For Absolute Beginners by Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)
* [CSS Crash Course For Absolute Beginners by Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI)

## JavaScript

If you are completely new to JavaScript, we recommend that you complete the course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

We also recommend that you work on solving coding exercises on [Codewars](https://codewars.com).

## Typing

If you work as a software developer, you will spend a lot of your time with a keyboard.

We recommend using a tool like [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to improve your typing speed.

## Text editor

During the course, we will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our text editor.

Watch this [series of videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) to get familiar with VS Code.
