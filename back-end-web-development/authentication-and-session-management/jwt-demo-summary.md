# JWT Demo: Summary

## Sample Codes

We have put the sample codes into the github repository:

* [Demo with JWT token in HTTP header](https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/express-jwt-authentication-demo/tree/solution)
* [Demo with JWT token in cookie](https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/express-jwt-authentication-demo/tree/solution_with_cookie)

## Another demo application

We have another similar and slightly more complicated [demo application](https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/express_passport_mongoose_example)

Most of the source codes in that demo project is similar to what you have learnt so far.
