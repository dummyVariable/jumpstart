# Progressive Web Applications

## Progressive Web App with Create-React-App

Create-React-App has out of the box support for Progressive Web App. You just need to opt-in by updating one line in the `index.js` generated by the create-react-app.

```javascript
// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: http://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
```
