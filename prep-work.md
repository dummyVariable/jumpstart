# Prep work

Here is a list of resources for you to pick up basic programming skills before day-one of the course.

Since your time during the course is precious, we would not spend much time on the basics. It's **important** that you **complete** the preparatory work listed below before day-one.

Task List

- Get familiar with basic elements of HTML and CSS
- Get familiar with syntax and core API of JavaScript
- Improve your typing speed

## HTML/CSS

Don't try to memorize the CSS properties. You can always find them in a reference:

## JavaScript

If you are totally new to JavaScript, here is an online course for beginners.

- [Codecademy - JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

The [tutorial on Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) is pretty good too.

If you prefer to learn by watching videos, you can take this course (paid course, but it's usually under promotion for less than 20 dollars):

- [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)

If you are keen to pick up a book, here is a good one:

- [Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/javascript-tutorial)(the first 5 chapters)

From time to time, you may need to refer to the core concepts/APIs in JavaScript. Here are some good references for you:

- [Dev Docs](http://devdocs.io/javascript/)

And remember to do exercises on [codewars](https://codewars.com) or [exercism](https://exercism.io/). Here are some [good exercises to learn JavaScript API](https://github.com/myjinxin2015/Katas-list-of-Training-JS-series)

## Text editor

During the course, we will set up [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our editor. If you're having trouble setting it up on your own, you can use the following online code editors:

- [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/) \(for javascript\)
- [https://codepen.io](https://codepen.io) \(for HTML, CSS, JavaScript\)

## Typing

If you work as a software developer, you will spend a lot of your time with a keyboard. We recommend using a tool like [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to improve your typing speed.
