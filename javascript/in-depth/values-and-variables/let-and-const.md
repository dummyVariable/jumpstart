# let and const

Before ES6, the only way to declare variables is to use `var`.

ES6 offers us 2 new \(and preferred ways\) to define variables:

* `const`   - for variables with values that should not be reassigned
* `let`     - for variables with values that can be reassigned

What are the differences?

## Difference between `let` and `const`

While you can assign a `let` variable to different values, once you assign a `const` variable to some initial value, you cannot changes its value.

```javascript
const a = 1

a = 2; // Error: â€‹Assignment to constant variable
```

However, if `const` variable points to an object, you can still modify the properties of that object, as the example below shows:

```javascript
const a = { b: 1};

a["b"] = 2;

console.log(a)
```

## Understanding scope of `var` and `let`/`const`

### What is scope?

Scope of a variable is the area of codes where the variable can be used.

### Global Scope and Function Scope

In ES5, there are only two type of scopes:

* global scope
  * When you define a variable without `var`, or define it outside a function, that variable is in global scope
  * There is a global object which stores all global variables. In browsers, that's called 'window'. In Node environment, that's called 'global'.
  * Use of global variables are discouraged in general, except for a few valid use cases 
* function scope
  * When you define `var` inside a function.

In the following example, the variable `b` is defined in the function, so it cannot be accessed from outside the function.

```javascript
// example of function scope. b exists only within the function
function a() {
  var b = 2
}

console.log(b) // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

### Understanding Variable Hoisting Effect with `var`

The `var` variables has an [hoisting effect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting): they can be used before their declaration, although the value you get is always `undefined` until you properly set the variable value.

In the following example, the variable `animalToFeed` is actually available through the whole function although it's define in a block:

```javascript
function feedPet() {
  console.log("The value of animalToFeed at the beginning of function: " + animalToFeed);

  if (true) {
    var animalToFeed = "cat";
  }

  console.log("The value of animalToFeed at the end of function: " + animalToFeed);
}

feedPet();
```

In this case, the variable `animalToFeed` is considered as declared since the beginning of the function. It remained undefined until it's assigned a value.

Try the example above and see if the output matches your understanding.

For `let` and `const`, if you try to use them before the declaration, you would get `ReferenceError`.

### Block Scope

The variable hoisting effect confused many people. In the example above, the variable `animalToFeed` is declared within the if-block, shouldn't it only be visible within that if-block?

That's not possible in ES5, but in ES6, there is one more scope added

* block scope:
  * When you define a variable with `let`. The variable belong to the scope defined by the closest enclosing `{}`

In the following example, the variable `animalToFeed` is not available outside the block \(i.e. the enclosing {}\) where it's defined.

```javascript
function feedPet() {
  console.log("The value of animalToFeed at the beginning of function: " + animalToFeed);

  if (true) {
    let animalToFeed = "cat";
  }

  console.log("The value of animalToFeed at the end of function: " + animalToFeed);
}

feedPet(); // ReferenceError: animalToFeed is not defined
```

## We should prefer let/const to var

* why `let` and `const` &gt; `var`:
  * prevent \(accidental\) variable reassignment
  * block scoped. no leaking into global scope
  * no need for [IIFE \(immediately invoked function expression\)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8228281/what-is-the-function-construct-in-javascript) to limit the scope of variables
  * avoid silent undefined values \(which `var` allows because of variable hoisting\). 

### Digging deeper

`let` and `const` fixes 4 problems which we encounter when using `var`:

1\) Block scoping of `let` and `const` prevents variables from leaking into global scope

```javascript
// with var
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    console.log(i)
}
console.log(i)      // prints 10. `i` has leaked into the global scope
// any variable that's intended to be used only within if statements, for loops (i.e. any curly braces that is not a function), will pollute the global scope!

// with let
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    console.log(i)
}
console.log(i)      // ReferenceError: i is not defined. Block scoping prevents pollution of global scope!
```

2\) `let` and `const` prevents accidental variable reassignment

```javascript
// with var
var x = 1000
// ... 100 lines of code later
var x = 'bob'
// silent and hard to detect bugs can happen because javascript let us change the value of x

// with let & const
let x = 1000
// ... 100 lines of code later
let x = 'bob'   // SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
const x = 'bob' // SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
```

3\) `let` and `const` prevent subtle bugs arising from variable hoisting

```javascript
// with var
// bad. 'fails' silently. javascript will let you refer to `x` before it's defined, leading to all sorts of weird things such as printing 'undefined' on your beautiful user interface
console.log(x);   // prints undefined
var x = 10;

// good. throws a ReferenceError, telling you that there's a bug in your code that you need to fix
console.log(y);
let y = 10;
```

4\) `let` and `const` keep variable scope within **callbacks**.

```javascript
// bad. prints 10 ten times after 1 second 
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
};

// good. prints 1 to 10 after 1 second, as we expected
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
};
```

**Rule of thumb**: use `const` by default. use `let` otherwise. In your projects/assignments, use `const` unless you intend to reassign another value to your variable.
