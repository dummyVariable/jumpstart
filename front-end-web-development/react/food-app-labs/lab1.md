## Feature details

- In this lab you are required to render a list of 10 restaurants upon page load

- Navigate to the food-app project directory on your computer
- checkout to the lab 1 branch

```
cd food-app
git checkout lab1
git branch
```

- Create 2 react components
  - HomePage
    - in src/components/HomePage/HomePage.jsx
    - this component will contain a list of Restaurant components
    - this component's state will store the list of restaurants
  - Restaurant
    - in src/components/Restaurant/Restaurant.jsx
    - this component will display the information of one restaurant

## Expected Output

This screenshot is a sample of the expected output after the page has loaded

![Restaurants listing](../../../.gitbook/assets/front-end-web-development/react/food-app-labs/lab1-output.png)

## Hints

- The style is for the Restaurant component is a [bootstrap card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/)
- you can access the restaurant data from RestaurantService `getRestaurants()`
- You can optionally install node-sass for using scss stylesheets

```
  npm install node-sass
```

## Solution

- After you have completed Lab 1, please commit all your work to the `lab1` branch

- You may optionally install the plugin **Git History Diff** for viewing the difference between git branches. This will allow you to easily compare your work with the sample solution

- [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huizhou.githd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huizhou.githd)

- Next checkout to the solution branch and we will now walk through the sample solution

```text
git checkout lab2
```

- To view the difference between your work and the sample solution go to the VS Code file explorer, right click your folder and select `GitHD: View Folder Diff` and select compare with `lab1` branch

- The diff sidebar will popup and you can click on the files to view the difference between your work and the sample solution.

- When viewing the diff you can temporarily toggle the sidebar with `cmd + B` to hide it.

## Testing

- Next we will discuss how to test the feature with react-testing-library
- To test React components in our project, we need to install test libraries:

```
  npm install @testing-library/react --save-dev
  npm install jest-dom --save-dev
```

- Note: It is not required to install jest as `create-react-app` already installs jest by default. And installing a different version on top of that can affect starting the app
