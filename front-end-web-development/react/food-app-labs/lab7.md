# Lab 7: Add feature to edit existing restaurants in the Admin page

In this lab you are required to create an `Edit` button which allows the Admin to edit the information of an existing restaurant

0. When the Admin clicks on the `Edit` button the page will navigate to a form with the fields pre filled with the restaurant's information
1. If the Admin changes some values, and clicks the `Save` button, the page will navigate back to the restaurant table
1. The edited restaurant will have its information updated

## Feature details

- Navigate to the food-app project directory on your computer
- checkout to the lab 7 branch

```
  git checkout lab7
  git branch
```

### Step 1: Link the Edit button to the RestaurantForm

- Create an `Edit` button and place it before the `Delete` button in the restaurants table
- Link the `Edit` button to the Restaurant form page with the route `restaurants/:id`
- Create route in App.js for `restaurants/:id` and render the RestaurantForm
- Ensure that when you click on the Edit button it is linked to the Form page

### Step 2: Display the values of the restaurant in the field

- In `ComponentDidMount()`, get the id of the restaurant from `this.props.match.params`
- Find the restaurant from its id with the `getRestaurants()` function
- Save the restaurant details to the state
- In `render()` read the values from the state and place them as the value attribute of each field

### Step 3: Modify the restaurant form title

- When RestaurantForm is used to create a new restaurant it is called `Create Restaurant`
- When the RestaurantForm is used to edit an existing restaurant, the title should change to `Edit Restaurant`

## Expected Output

This screenshot is a sample of the expected output

![Edit restaurant button on the Admin page](../../../.gitbook/assets/front-end-web-development/react/food-app-labs/lab7-output-1.png)

![Restaurant form pre filled with values of restaurant](../../../.gitbook/assets/front-end-web-development/react/food-app-labs/lab7-output-2.png)

## Hints

- if you have trouble displaying the value in the select field try replacing `defaultValue=""` with `value={value}`

## Solution

- After you have completed Lab 7, please commit all your work to the `lab7` branch

- You may optionally install the plugin **Git History Diff** for viewing the difference between git branches. This will allow you to easily compare your work with the sample solution

- [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huizhou.githd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huizhou.githd)

- Next checkout to the solution branch and we will now walk through the sample solution

```text
git checkout lab8
```

- To view the difference between your work and the sample solution go to the VS Code file explorer, right click your folder and select `GitHD: View Folder Diff` and select compare with `lab7` branch

- The diff sidebar will popup and you can click on the files to view the difference between your work and the sample solution.

- When viewing the diff you can temporarily toggle the sidebar with `cmd + B` to hide it.

## Testing

- Next we will discuss how to test the feature with react testing library
