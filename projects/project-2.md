# Build a web API

## Requirements

Build a server-side application to handle CRUD requests!

To pass this project, you must apply what you've learned

* express
* mongodb
* authentication
* tests \(with good coverage\)
* CI and deployment
* docs \(with swagger\)

If you need ideas on what to build, you can try one of the following:

* serving data loaded from static files \(e.g. csv, json, xml, etc\)
* getting data from another API and serving it \(perhaps in a more useful format\)
* build a backend for a project that you want to eventually build a front-end for
