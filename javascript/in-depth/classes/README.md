# Object Oriented JavaScript

When JavaScript was invented, the creator borrowed a lot of features/ideas from object oriented language like Java.

There are unique features like prototype-based inheritance, and there are also half-baked features like `new` and `class`. Later on, the language designers made some improvements to make `class` in JavaScript more usable.

In this section, we will learn how to use the `class` in JavaScript properly, and how it is related to prototype-based inheritance.
