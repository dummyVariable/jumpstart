# Merge hell

If and when we don't follow the practice of \(i\) committing often and \(ii\) push often on the master branch \(a.k.a. trunk-based development\), we can land ourselves in merge hell.

Merge hell is a sticky place and getting out of it can be painful and time-consuming \(it can take hours or even days\). Instead of building your application, now you have to spend time tearing your hair out!
