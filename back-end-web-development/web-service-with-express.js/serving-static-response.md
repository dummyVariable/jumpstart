# Serving static files with Express.js

Besides building REST APIs with Express, you can also run an Express application that serve some static HTML/JavaScript/CSS files.

This is useful when you would like to host your frontend application \(e.g. a React app\) in the same web server that hosts the backend application \(e.g. the REST API built with Express\).

Refer to the [official documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) for this usage.
